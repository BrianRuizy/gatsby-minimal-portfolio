Previously I was working as a Software Engineer with PeriShip, and contributing to various Django projects, ranging from IT to client-facing web applications. Here I've been able to design and develop with a more full stack approach, for instance writing and working with REST API services, and consuming with more modern front-end frameworks  like React, Vue.JS, and working with AJAX for asynchronous SPA's single page applications.

PeriShip focuses on providing digital solutions to a wide range of customers who wish to ship valuable and or time sensitive products. Given our exclusive partnership with FedEX, we can leverage the best of existing logistics infrastructure and provide excellent customer service through our digital solutions. And, recently the organization has been specializing and onboarding a wave of pharmaceutical clients.

One of the larger projects I've been assigned to here with PeriShip was porting the customer shipment-claims appliciation to our various different projects. Furthermore, adding more functionality to query the collection of shipment claims.
