## The Challenge

The main objective of the competition revolved around developing innovative solutions for improving the infrastructure of cities. The **[Smart Infrastructure Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/smart-infrastructure-hackathon-tickets-76918610635#)** was hosted at The Cannon, in partnership with Microsoft. Thankfully, we had a team of really bright cloud architects for guidance 👍.

After brainstorming and juggling several ideas we settled with the issue of road potholes. We found that potholes cost American drivers $6.4 billion dollars per year, that is in both repair and insurance cost's. Additionally, the average price to repair a pothole including labor is about **$30 - $50** per pothole, while the damage that single pothole may cause are up to **$300**/year per vehicle. (2016) [pothole.info](https://www.pothole.info/2016/05/so-many-potholes-so-much-cost/)  Thus the effort to aiding this issue can be extremely cost-effective.

## The result 🥇
Having won the competition, post minimum-viable-product, granted us full access to MS Azure cloud infrastucture. Which we will employ for the future continued development of the application*.
